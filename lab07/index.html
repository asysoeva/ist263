    <h2>Personal info</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Anastasia Sysoeva, and I am a double major in Finance and
      Information Management &amp; Technology (Data Analytics).
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m interested in how finance and data work together to support smarter
      decisions, whether that’s analyzing markets, evaluating investments, or
      using data to understand trends and performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my key skills include Excel, SQL, Python, along with strong
      communication, teamwork, and follow-through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of academics, I’m a Division I tennis player, which has taught me
      discipline, resilience, and how to stay calm under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also enjoy exploring new places, staying active, and spending time with
      friends and family. Having moved from Russia, I value new experiences and
      different perspectives, and I bring that mindset into everything I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing I’m especially proud of is my <strong>discipline</strong> because
      it helps me balance everything I do.
    </p>
