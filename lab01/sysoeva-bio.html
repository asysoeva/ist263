    My name is Anastasia Sysoeva, and I am a double major in Finance and Information Management & Technology (Data Analytics). 
    I’m interested in how finance and data work together to support smarter decisions, whether that’s analyzing markets, 
    evaluating investments, or using data to understand trends and performance.Some of my key skills include Excel, SQL, Python, 
    along with strong communication, teamwork, and follow-through. Outside of academics, I’m a Division I tennis player, which has taught me discipline, 
    resilience, and how to stay calm under pressure. I also enjoy exploring new places, staying active, and spending time with friends and family. 
    Having moved from Russia, I value new experiences and different perspectives, and I bring that mindset into everything I do.
